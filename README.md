An Arcade game built just for practicing Python3 and the PyGame Library. You can find more information in the wiki section.

Trying the PyGame Python Library. The game presented here was based on the project suggested in the "Python Crash Course Book". I tried to modify and make it look like some sort of a Star Wars Version of the old Space Invaders game.

Next steps are the addition of a Score method and a Highscores Section.

The sprites used were extracted from the following website:
