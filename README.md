# Space Invaders - Star Wars Edition
This is my first time trying the PyGame Python Library. The game developed here was based on a project suggested in the "Python Crash Course" book, which consisted basically in reproducing the classic space invaders using the PyGame framework. As a Star Wars fan, I tried to modify it in order to make it look like some sort of a Empire vs Rebels version of it.
